=head1 NAME

mksite - Generate a web site for a CPAN module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ mksite My::Lovely::Module

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program will automatically generate a web site for a CPAN module
(actually, it's more accurate to say a CPAN distribution). It gets the
information used to create the site from two sources:

=over 4

=item * It uses the MetaCPAN API to get data about the distribution.

=item * It uses templates and other files that can be stored in the code
repository for the distribution.

=back

Note that the first of these items creates a tiny caveat as you can only use
this module to create sites for distributions that the MetaCPAN API knows about
- i.e. distributions that have been released to CPAN.

=head1 TODO

This documentation needs a lot of expansion. I'll be doing that over the
next few weeks.
