<div style="border: red 2px solid; padding: 0.5em">
<p>This is the default content for a web site that is generated by
<a href="https://davorg.dev/app-cpanmodulesite">App::CPANModuleSite</a>.</p>

<p>If this is your site and you want to change this into more interesting
content, create a file called <tt>tt_lib/intro.tt</tt> in your module's
repository and regenerate this site (by running <tt>mksite</tt>).</p>
